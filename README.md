# Pine A64(+) Fan Controller

## Files

__pine64_fan.py__ → Trivial pine64 fan controller based on schematics by MarkHaysHarris777 from http://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=1854

__pine64_fan.service__ → Systemd unit file for pine64_fan.py

__pine64_monitor.sh__ → A fan-aware pine64 health monitoring script. The most of it was stolen quite shamelessly from longsleep's pine64_health.sh found at https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image/tree/master/simpleimage/platform-scripts

__install.sh__ → A rather crude pine64_fan installation script for systemd
